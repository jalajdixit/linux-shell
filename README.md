# linux-shell
Designing my own shell (command interpreter) for linux terminal

		jshell help section

	curpid: show pid of process
	  ppid: show parent process id
	cd Dir: change the directory
	  hist: show history of 10 commands
	  help: show help section of jshell
	  quit: exit from jshell

* jshell supports,
  * multiple commands (;)
  * input redirection (<)
  * output redirection (>)
  * pipeline mechanism (|)
